      The useCallback hook in React is used to memoize a function, which means
      that the function will only be recreated when its dependencies change.
      This can be useful when passing a function as a prop to a child component,
      as it can prevent unnecessary re-renders of the child component. By
      memoizing the function, you can ensure that the function reference remains
      the same between renders, unless the dependencies change. This can lead to
      performance improvements in certain situations, especially when the
      function is expensive to create.
